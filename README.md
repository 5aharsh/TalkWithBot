# TalkWithBot
Facebook's simple talking bot on messenger

### About CURL.exe
For windows system in order to execute `curl -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/me/subscribed_apps?access_token=<PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN>"` for initiating bot functioning. It's optional even for Windows users but they will have to install it manually and set environment variable for it anyway.
